It is generally safer to perform calculations using a supercell. This is because when calculating COOP, the unit cell is expanded to a supercell, and the influence of equivalent atoms in adjacent unit cells is included in the results. </p>"},{"location":"#running-fhi-aims","title":"Running FHI-aims","text":"<p>In the <code>control.in</code> file, please add the following output specification:</p> <p><pre><code>output coop_set\n</code></pre> This write command activates the generation of two output files:</p> <ul> <li>eigenvec.out - Contains eigenvector information</li> <li>coop_set.out - Contains the remaining information necessary for COOP analysis</li> </ul> <p>These files will serve as inputs for the subsequent chemical bonding analysis step with aims-chembond.</p>"},{"location":"#running-aims-chembond","title":"Running aims-chembond","text":"<p>After performing the FHI-aims calculation, you will perform chemical bonding analysis using the <code>aims.chembond.0.0.1.x</code>. To use aims-chembond, you need three input files: eigenvec.out, coop_set.out, and control_chembond.in.</p> <p>aims-chembond provides functionality to calculate both PDOS (Partial Density of States) and COOP (Crystal Orbital Overlap Population). To calculate PDOS, include the following content in your control_chembond.in file:</p> <p><pre><code>output pdos -20 20 401 0.3\natom 1\natom 2\n</code></pre> Here, <code>output pdos -20 20 401 0.3</code> defines the energy window parameters for the PDOS spectra: the lower bound, the upper bound, the number of points, and the Gaussian broadening factor. The <code>atom</code> tag specifies the atom index for which to calculate the PDOS.</p> <p>Similarly, to calculate COOP, include or append the following content to the control_chembond.in file: <pre><code>output coop -20 20 401 0.3\natom_pair 1 2\norbital_pair 3 18\natom_orb_pair 1 3s 2 3p\n</code></pre> In the example above, <code>atom_pair 1 2</code> calculates the COOP between atom 1 and atom 2. <code>orbital_pair 3 18</code> calculates the COOP between the 3rd orbital and the 18th orbital. <code>atom_orb_pair 1 3s 2 3p</code> calculates the COOP between the 3s orbital component of atom 1 and the 3p orbital component of atom 2.</p> <p>aims-chembond is parallelized across k-points. You can execute the calculation using MPI with a command like: <code>mpiexec -n 6 aims.chembond.0.0.1.x</code>.</p> <p>Information</p> <p>PDOS and COOP analyses are highly dependent on the choice of basis functions. While the \"light\" basis set offers a good starting point, you should carefully validate your results to ensure their accuracy and reliable interpretation.</p>"},{"location":"#citing","title":"Citing","text":"<p>If you find aims-chembond helpful, please consider citing:</p> <pre><code>Izumi Takahara, Kiyou Shibata, and Teruyasu Mizoguchi\n\"Crystal orbital overlap population based on all-electron ab initio simulation with numeric atom-centered orbitals and its application to chemical-bonding analysis in Li-intercalated layered materials\"\nModelling Simul.
